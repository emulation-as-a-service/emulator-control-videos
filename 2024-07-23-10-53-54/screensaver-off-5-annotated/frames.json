You can type a value or use the up/down arrows to adjust it.\n* **\"On resume, password protect\" Checkbox:** Enabling this requires a password to exit the screen saver and return to the desktop, enhancing security.\n\n**2. Monitor Power Management:**\n\n* **\"Monitor power\" Section:** This section provides a brief explanation of monitor power settings.\n* **Power Button:** Clicking this button opens a separate dialog box (\"Power Options Properties\") for configuring detailed power management settings, including sleep modes and power schemes.\n\nFinally, at the bottom of the dialog box are the standard \"OK,\" \"Cancel,\" and \"Apply\" buttons. \"OK\" applies changes and closes the dialog, \"Cancel\" discards any changes, and \"Apply\" applies changes without closing the dialog. \n",
