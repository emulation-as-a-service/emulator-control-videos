Below the title bar, a tabbed interface allows navigation between \"Themes,\" \"Desktop,\" \"Screen Saver,\" \"Appearance,\" and \"Settings.\" The \"Screen Saver\" tab is currently active.\n\nWithin the \"Screen Saver\" tab, the following elements are present:\n\n- **Screen Saver Dropdown Menu:** This dropdown menu, currently displaying \"(None),\" allows the user to choose from a list of available screen savers.\n- **\"Wait\" Input Field and Dropdown Menu:** The \"Wait\" field, set to \"10\" and accompanied by a minutes dropdown, determines the idle time before the chosen screen saver activates.\n- **\"On resume, password protect\" Checkbox:** This checkbox, currently unchecked, enables password protection upon resuming from the screen saver.\n- **\"Settings\" Button:** This button likely leads to a separate window for customizing the selected screen saver's settings (not visible in the screenshot).\n- **\"Preview\" Button:** This button allows the user to preview the chosen screen saver within the small monitor display area above.\n- **\"Monitor power\" Section:** This section contains information about adjusting monitor power settings and a clickable \"Power...\" button. \n- **\"OK,\" \"Cancel,\" and \"Apply\" Buttons:** These standard buttons confirm, discard, or apply any changes made within the \"Display Properties\" window.\n\nThe screenshot indicates that the user has selected \"(None)\" as their screen saver. The \"OK\" button is highlighted, suggesting it has been clicked or is currently selected via keyboard navigation. \n \n Notably, the \"Power...\" button provides access to further power management options, indicating the potential for additional configuration beyond the screen saver settings. \n",
