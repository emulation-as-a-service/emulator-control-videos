The user navigates to the Control Panel and selects "Appearance and Themes". Then, the user opens "Display Properties", goes to the "Screen Saver" tab, and selects "None" as the screensaver. Finally, the user navigates to the "Power Options Properties" window and changes the "System hibernates" option to "Never" for both "Home/Office Desk" and "Always On" power schemes.
