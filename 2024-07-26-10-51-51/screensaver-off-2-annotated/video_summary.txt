The user right-clicks on the desktop and selects "Properties" from the context menu. In the "Display Properties" window, the user clicks on the "Screen Saver" tab, selects "None" from the "Screen Saver" dropdown menu, and sets the "Wait" time to "10" minutes. The user then clicks on the "Power" button, which opens the "Power Options Properties" window.
