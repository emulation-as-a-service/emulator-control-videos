The user right-clicks on the desktop, opens the "Properties" option, navigates to the "Screen Saver" tab within "Display Properties", changes the screen saver to "None", and applies the changes. The user then opens the "Power Options Properties" by clicking "Power" and changes the "Turn off hard disks" setting from "After 20 mins" to "After 4 hours". Finally, the user applies these changes as well.
