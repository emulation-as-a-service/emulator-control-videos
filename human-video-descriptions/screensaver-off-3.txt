Open the Windows XP start menu by pressing the keys Ctrl+Esc. Next, press the key "C" to launch the control panel. In the windows' side bar, click on "Switch to classic view". The window will redraw with a greater number of icons appearing. Start typing "power" ("po" is actually enough) to select the "Power Options" icon, and hit Enter to open the "Power Options Porperties" window. Select "Never" in the "Turn off monitor" dropdown menu. Click OK to confirm the settings, which will return to the "Control Panel" window. Launch the "Display Properties" panel by double-clicking the icon with the same label. In the appearing "Display Properties" window, from the top row of tabs, click "Screen Saver" and change the selected screensaver to "[None]" using the drop down menu. Confirm the changed setting by clicking "OK". This will return you to the "Control Panel" which you now can also close with the button showing an X located in the top window title bar. You have now successfully disabled any screen saver or power saver functionality of the operating system.
