Right-click on an empty area of the desktop. A context menu will appear, click on the option named "Properties". This will bring up the "Display Properties" window. In the top row of tabs, click on "Screen Saver". Now screen saver options will be displayed, and a dropdown menu allows to select a style of screen saver. Click on the menu and select "[None]" from the list by clicking on it. Click the "Apply" button in the lower part of the window to commit this change. Next, click the "Power" button. The "Power Options Properties" window will appear. Make sure that the options "Turn off monitor", "Turn off hard disks", "System standby", and System hibernates" are set to "Never". Then close this window by clicking the bottom "OK" button. You'll be returned to the "Display Properties" window, which you now can also close by clicking "OK". Now you have disabled all screen saver functionality of the operating system.
