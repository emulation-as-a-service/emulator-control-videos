The "Power schemes" dropdown menu displays "Always On" as the currently selected power scheme. Below, the "Settings for Always On power scheme" section allows customization of inactivity-based power-saving features:

- **"Turn off monitor"**: Currently set to "After 20 mins", indicating the monitor will turn off after 20 minutes of inactivity. A dropdown arrow allows selection of alternative durations.
- **"Turn off hard disks"**: Set to "Never", preventing the hard drive from powering down after a period of inactivity. A dropdown arrow is visible for alternative settings.
- **"System standby"**: Set to "Never", disabling the system standby (sleep) mode.
- **"System hibernates"**: Also set to "Never", disabling the system hibernation mode.

At the bottom of the window, several buttons provide actions related to the power scheme settings:

- **"OK"**: Confirms and applies the selected power scheme and its settings, closing the window.
- **"Cancel"**: Discards any changes made and closes the window, reverting to the previous settings.
- **"Apply"**: Immediately applies the selected power scheme and its settings without closing the window.
